The third_party/torch-mlir-dialects directory is used to import torch-mlir
specific dialects. This is needed transitively to provide dialects interfaces
to bridge between torch-mlir and IREE. After the related dialects are upstreamed
to mlir core as planned, this directory should no longer be needed.
