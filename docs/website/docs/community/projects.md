# Community projects

*   The [IREE C++ Template](https://github.com/iml130/iree-template-cpp)
    demonstrates how to integrate IREE into a third-party project with CMake.
    The project demonstrates the usage of runtime support and how to use a
    custom dialect alongside with the runtime.

*   The [IREE LLVM Sandbox](https://github.com/google/iree-llvm-sandbox)
    contains experimental work by the IREE team closely related to LLVM and
    MLIR, usually with the aim of contributing back to those upstream projects
    in some form.
