# All of IREE is in the Google style except for iree/compiler/, which follows
# mostly LLVM style (for naming/etc) but the Google formatting (because internal
# tooling has... issues).
BasedOnStyle: Google

# Some includes have specific inclusion order requirements. To prevent
# clang-format from breaking things when bucketing headers into categories we
# override the behavior here for those well-known headers.
IncludeCategories:
  # We override VK_NO_PROTOTYPES so we don't pull in auto-imported symbols and
  # this must always sort above any header (ours or otherwise) that may
  # transitively #include <vulkan/vulkan.h>.
