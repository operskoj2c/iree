# Common configuration for Kokoro builds that run the core build on bazel on
# linux.

# This file is intentionally left empty, and will be removed soon. This is being
# done as a part of moving `kokoro/gcp_ubuntu/bazel/` to
# `kokoro/gcp_ubuntu/bazel/core/`, and allows for our CI to gracefully stop
# using this build config.
