Dialects used for interfacing to TensorFlow.

This directory should be structured similar to `iree/compiler/Dialect`, except
that google naming conventions are used throughout. The reason for this is that
these dialects should in principle be useful to any TensorFlow compiler, and
potentially will be upstreamed into the main TensorFlow repo.
