    If index is out of bounds of the valid tensors, but is in bounds of the
    reserved capacity, then `element_shape` controls the shape of the returned
    value, which will be filled with zeros.

    If element_shape is a fully defined shape (that is, contains no `-1` values),
    then zeros of that shape are returned. Otherwise, that shape is merged with
    the shape of all the other valid tensors in the list (that is an O(N)
    operation), and the resulting shape is used for creating the zeros.
