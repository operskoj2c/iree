# TensorFlow builds through bazel, and IREE maintains all of its TensorFlow
# dependent code under this directory tree. The CMake support is limited to
# compiler binaries and python bindings.
#
# Bazel is a beast that likes to be the center of the universe. There is some
# fragility in delegating to it in this fashion.
#
# If this directory is included, then building TensorFlow is assumed (the
# config option happens at the higher level).
