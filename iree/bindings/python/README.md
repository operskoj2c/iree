# IREE Python Sandbox

This directory contains various integration-oriented Python utilities that are
not intended to be a public API. They are, however, useful for lower level
compiler interop work. And of course, they are useful since we presently lack a
real API :)

We're still untangling build support, jupyter integration, etc for OSS builds.
Stand by.
