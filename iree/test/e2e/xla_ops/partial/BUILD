# Tests of end-to-end IREE support for support of specific subsets of ops in the
# XLA HLO dialect. This is for cases where some variation (e.g. tensor element
# types) of an op is not supported on all backends. When the test is supported
# on all backends it should be moved into the corresponding op test in the main
# xla_ops direcotry. Each test file should have a name matching the
# corresponding XLA HLO op with a suffix indicating the subset it tests. Only
# the functionality of that op should be tessted (though it may make use of
# other ops where necessary). Tests should be written using the IREE Check
# framework and should always pass on the reference VMLA backend. See
# https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/docs/developers/developing_iree/testing_guide.md#iree-core-end-to-end-tests.
