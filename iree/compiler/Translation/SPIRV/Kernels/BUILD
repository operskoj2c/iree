# A collection of hand-written kernels for special ops that cannot (yet) be
# generated by the compiler.
#
# This is a grab bag right now during bringup with little structure. If you
# have ideas on how to make this better please ping us :)
#
# To use the kernels add a dep against this package and use
# mlir::iree_compiler::spirv::Kernels_create() to get the FileToc. Kernels
# will have filenames matching their original with the extension changed to
# '.spv' (for example 'add.comp' -> 'add.spv').
