// A lightweight unfair lock.
// Depending on platform this is significantly smaller than a mutex (4-8 bytes
// vs 64+ bytes), can always be statically initialized/requires no allocations,
// and performs the minimal amount of work possible while still playing nicely
// with the OS thread scheduler.
//
// Unlike a full mutex these don't have the ability to be shared across
// processes (not something we care about), don't have a way to define timeouts,
// and have only a binary held/unheld state. They are often an order of
// magnitude faster in uncontended/lightly-contended code and the same
// performance in highly-contended code, though, so it's worth it for locks that
// be guarding small data structures (queue pointers, etc) and touched from many
// threads. Since they are so lightweight it's possible to embed them per-object
// instead of per-manager and change from a single highly-contended lock to
// thousands of almost completely uncontended slim locks.
//
// Though these locks support spinning they always have a fallback path that
// ends up calling into the kernel to properly wait the thread. This is critical
// to avoid pathological cases under contention and allowing for thread priority
// inheritance when there are multiple threads competing that may otherwise be
// scheduled in a potentially livelocking order.
//
// The "unfair" here comes from the fact that it's possible on certain platforms
// for certain threads to never be able to acquire the lock in cases of
// extremely high contention or widely disparate thread priority levels. This is
// mitigated by ensuring only very small regions of code are guarded and that
// there's enough work happening outside of the lock on any particular thread to
// ensure that there's some chance of other threads being able to acquire it.
