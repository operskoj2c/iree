# TODO(benvanik): replace iree/base/arena.h with this one. We still want the
# old-style arena for pure stack use; we may be able to do that with a change
# to block pool that allows for on-stack initialization (iree_stack_arena_t
# that has storage for one block inside itself and then dynamically allocates
# new ones if needed). That way we have only one arena implementation and can
# easily use the iree_allocator_t interface without worry.
