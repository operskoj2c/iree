# To use the host GPUs, `docker run` must be called with the `--gpus all` flag.

# Set up the image and working directory by inheriting the vulkan CMake
# configuration.
# Note that we don't start from NVIDIA's docker base:
# - nvidia/cuda (https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda):
#     it's.. for CUDA.
# - nvidia/vulkan (https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/vulkan):
#      does not support Ubuntu 18.04.
# This allows to share configuration with base CMake, but it also means we need
# to MATCH the driver version between the host machine and the docker image.
