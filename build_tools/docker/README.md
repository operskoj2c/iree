# IREE Docker Configuration

This directory contains the Dockerfiles that specify the container images used
for IREE. Images are uploaded to
[Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry).

To build an image, use `docker build`, e.g.:

```shell
docker build build_tools/docker/cmake --tag cmake
```

To explore an image interactively, use `docker run`, e.g.

```shell
docker run --interactive --tty --rm cmake
```

You can find more information in the
[official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

## Multi-stage Builds

We use
[multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)
to limit duplication in our Dockerfiles and reduce the final image size. There
is still duplication in cases where it's difficult to determine the correct
files to copy.

## Dependencies Between Images

IREE images follow a consistent structure. The image defined by
`build_tools/docker/foo-bar/Dockerfile` is uploaded to GCR as
`gcr.io/iree-oss/foo-bar`. It may be tagged as `latest` or `prod`, e.g.
`gcr.io/iree-oss/foo-bar:latest`. Dockerfile image definitions should list their
dependencies based on these image names.

We use a helper python script to manage the Docker image deployment. It lists
all images and their dependencies and manages their canonical registry location.
When creating a new image, add it to this mapping. To build an image and all
images it depends on:

```shell
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py --build --image cmake
```

To build multiple images

```shell
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py --build --image cmake --image bazel
```

There is also the special option `--image all` to build all registered images.

Pushing images to GCR requires the `Storage Admin` role in the `iree-oss` GCP
project. To push these images to GCR with the `latest` tag:

```shell
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py --image cmake --push
```

Kokoro build scripts and RBE configuration refer to images by their repository
digest. You can update references to the digest:

```shell
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py --images all --tag latest --update_references
```

This requires that the tagged image have a repository digest, which means it was
pushed to or pulled from GCR.

## Adding or Updating an Image

If you have worked with the `docker` images before, it is prudent to follow the
steps in the "Debugging" section below before continuing.

### Part 1. Local Changes

1. Update the `Dockerfile` for the image that you want to modify or add. If
   you're adding a new image, or updating the dependencies between images, be
   sure to update `IMAGES_TO_DEPENDENCIES` in `manage_images.py` as well.
2. Build the image, push the image to GCR and update all references to the image
   with the new GCR digest:

    ```shell
    python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py \
      --image "${IMAGE?}" --build \
      --tag latest \
      --push \
      --update_references
    ```

3. Test that the changes behave as expected locally and iterate on the steps
   above.

### Part 2. Submitting to GitHub

4. Commit the changes and send a PR for review. The CI will use the updated
   digest references to test the new images.

5. Merge your PR after is approved and all CI tests pass. **Please remember to
   complete the step below**.

### Part 3. Updating the `:prod` tag

Kokoro builds preload images tagged with `prod` on VM creation, so after
changing the images used, you should also update the images tagged as `prod`
in GCR. This also makes development significantly easier for others who need to
modify the `docker` images.

6. We use `build_tools/docker/prod_digests.txt` as a source of truth for which
   versions of the images on GCR should have the `:prod` tag. The following
   command will ensure that you are at upstream HEAD on the `main` branch before
   it updates the tags.

    ```shell
    python3 build_tools/docker/manage_prod.py
    ```

## Debugging

Sometimes old versions of the `:latest` images can be stored locally and produce
unexpected behaviors. The following commands will download all of the prod
images and then update the images tagged with `:latest` on your machine (and on
GCR).

```shell
# Pull all images that should have :prod tags. (They won't if someone ignores
# step 6 above, but the images that this command pulls are correct regardless).
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_prod.py --pull_only

# Update the :latest images to match the :prod images.
# If you have a clean workspace this shouldn't require building anything as
# everything should be cache hits from the :prod images downloaded above.
python3 build_tools/docker/manage_images.py \
  --images all --build \
  --tag latest \
  --push \
  --update_references
```
