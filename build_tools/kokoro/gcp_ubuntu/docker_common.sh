# Functions for setting up Docker containers to run on Kokoro

# Sets up files and environment to enable running all our Kokoro docker scripts.
# In particular, does some shenanigans to enable running with the current user.
# Some of this setup is only strictly necessary for Bazel, but it doesn't hurt
# for anything else.
# Requires that KOKORO_ROOT and KOKORO_ARTIFACTS_DIR have been set
# Sets the environment variable DOCKER_RUN_ARGS to be used by subsequent
# `docker run` invocations.

    # Linux workstations do some interesting stuff with user/group permissions
    # such that they don't contain the information about normal users and we
    # want these scripts to be runnable locally for debugging.
