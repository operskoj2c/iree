# There are two ways to enable WTF at compile time:
#   1) Arrange to add a --copt=-DWTF_ENABLE to your build.
#   2) Add --define=GLOBAL_WTF_ENABLE=1 to the bazel command line
# The disadvantage to #1 is that you end up building the entire codebase
# with a non-standard copt. Depending on the size of your deps, this
# can use a lot of resources due to inability to hit the forge cache.
#
# The advantage to #2 is that it narrowly scopes the copt change just to
# things that depend on WTF, limiting the scope of things that need to
# be compiled differently.
